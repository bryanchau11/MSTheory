. The World (Cell Space)
A 2D grid of cells, typically 30x30 or 40x40.
Wrapped Boundaries: The grid is a torus. Moving off the top edge brings you to the bottom, moving off the left brings you to the right, etc.
Provided Code: SheepGrassCellSpace.java provides two crucial methods:
DoBoundaryToBoundaryCoupling(): Sets up the wrapped couplings between edge cells.
getNeighborXYCoord(): Calculates the coordinates of a neighbor in any of the 8 directions, respecting the wrapped boundaries.
2. The Agents & Their Behaviors

A. Grass

State: A cell can be EMPTY or contain GRASS.
Reproduction:
Every grassReproduceT time units, a grass cell tries to reproduce.
It picks one random empty neighbor cell.
If an empty neighbor exists, it creates a new grass there. If not, nothing happens.
B. Sheep

State: A cell can contain a SHEEP. A cell cannot have both grass and a sheep simultaneously.
Movement (sheepMoveT):
A sheep is always trying to move.
It takes sheepMoveT time units to complete a move.
Movement Logic:
Prefers to move to a random neighbor cell that has grass.
If no grass neighbors, moves to a random empty neighbor cell.
If all neighbors are occupied by other sheep, the move fails.
Critical Detail: The destination cell is only claimed at the end of the move duration. This prevents "pre-booking" a cell that might be taken by another sheep.
Eating: When a sheep successfully moves into a grass cell, the grass is immediately consumed (the cell becomes EMPTY or contains only the sheep).
Energy/Life (sheepLifeT):
A sheep has an "energy" or "life" timer counting down from sheepLifeT.
Each time it eats grass, this timer is reset.
If the timer reaches zero, the sheep dies (the cell becomes EMPTY).
Reproduction (sheepReproduceT):
Every sheepReproduceT time units, a sheep tries to reproduce.
It picks one random empty neighbor cell.
If an empty neighbor exists, a new sheep is created there at the end of the reproduction time.
If all neighbors are occupied, nothing happens.
Confluent Events: If a sheep is supposed to die and reproduce at the same time, the death takes precedence (it dies and does not reproduce).
